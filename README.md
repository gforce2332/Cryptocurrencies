## Overview

This project implements machine learning to create an analysis to discover trends for possible investment in new currencies. To accomplish this, we need to create a report that includes the current cryptocurrencies on the trading market and how these currencies can be grouped together to create a classification system for a new investment portfolio.

After preprocessing the targeted dataset, fitting it into a clustering algorithm (KMeans) and running the unsupervised machine learning modes, we can share our findings using data visualizations.
